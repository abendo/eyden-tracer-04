## Problem 1
### Sphere Solid (Points 25)
In this assignment we will continue working with _compound objects_: solids. 
1. Fork the current repository.
2. Modify the README.md file in your fork and put your name above.
3. Have a look at the new classes ```CSolidQuad``` and ```CSolidCone```. Study how a quadrilateral and a cone may be constructed from triangles.
4. Implement the ```CSolidSphere``` class  in the same way as ```CSolidCone``` class is implemented. Please provide your code with comments.

**Hint 1:** Make use of [spherical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system).

**Hint 2:** Sphere will consist of two "caps": top and bottom, consisting out of triangles, and the "sides", consisting out of quadrilaterals. Additional insights may be found in [```rt::CSolidCylinder``` constructor](https://github.com/Project-10/OpenRT/blob/master/modules/core/SolidCylinder.cpp). You might need to use _height segments_ for the sphere as well. Please use the number of height segments equal to the half of the number of sphere's sides.

If your implementation works as expected you should see an image of 3 geometrical objects:

## Problem 2 
### Vertex Normals (Points 25)
Rather then storing a single _geometry normal_ for a triangle, it is often useful to store at each _vertex_ a corresponding _vertex normal_. The advantage is that if we have a hit point on a triangle, the shading normal can be smoothly interpolated between the vertex normals. If neighboring triangles share the same vertex normals, a smooth appearance can be generated over non-smooth tesselated geometry.  
Proceed as follows:
1. Your ray class is extended with two additional ```float``` values called ```Ray::u``` and ```Ray::v```.
2. In ```bool CPrimTriangle::intersect(Ray& ray) const```, store the computed barycentric coordinates into ```Ray::u``` and ```Ray::v```.  
   > Note: as long as your other classes (_e.g._ ```CPrimSphere```) don’t need local surface coordinates, there is no need to compute them yet.
3. Class ```CPrimTriangle``` now stores the vertex normals (```m_na```, ```m_nb``` and ```m_nc```) additionaly to the original vertex positions. 
   > Note: that all the vertex normals are optionals. Please pay extra attantion to how they initialized in the constructor.
4. In ```Vec3f CPrimTriangle::getNormal(const Ray& ray) const``` check whether the vertex normals are initialized and if yes, use the _u_/_v_ coordinates of the hitpoint to interpolate between the vertex normals and return interpolated normal.
   > Note: interpolating normalized vectors will not return a normalized vector! Make sure to normalize your interpolated normal!
5. Extend the code in ```CSolidCone``` constructor in such a way that the triangles will be created with the additional normals. Calculate these normals and pass them within the triangles' constructors. What normal will be chosen for the _top_ vertex? Please explain in comments.
   > Note: if you stuck here, you may refere to OpenRT library: [```rt::CSolidCone```](https://github.com/Project-10/OpenRT/blob/master/modules/core/SolidCone.cpp)
6. Extend your code in ```CSolidSphere``` constructor in such a way that the triangles will be created with the additional normals. Calculate these normals (_e.g._ using the spherical coordinate system) and pass them within the triangles' and quads' constructors.
7. Test your implementation on the scene from Problem 1. Compare the difference between the Solid and Primitive spheres. Explain below why smoothed cone looks strange. How would you fix it?

## Problem 3
### Texturing Primitives (Points 25)
Until now we have only used one color per object. Nevertheless, in reality, _e.g._ in games, objects are very often colorful because of the usage of textures. This is also a way of making a surface look more geometrically complex. Usually, textures are used by storing _texture coordinates_ at the vertices of each triangles, and interpolating those to find the correct texel that has to be used for a surface point.
1. Study new class ```CTexture``` added to the framework.
2. Classes ```CShaderFlat``` and ```CShaderEyelight``` now have additional constructors, which take a texture instead of a color as a parameter.
3. Class ```IPrim``` now has additional virtual method ```virtual Vec2f getTextureCoords(const Ray& ray) const = 0;``` which should be implemented in all derived classes. 
4. Implement method ```Vec2f CPrimSphere::getTextureCoords(const Ray& ray) const``` using spherical coordinates and lecture notes. The method should return the _x_ and _y_ coordinates of the interpolated vertex texture coordinates.
   > Note: if you stuck here, you may refere to OpenRT library: [```rt::CPrimSphere```](https://github.com/Project-10/OpenRT/blob/master/modules/core/PrimSphere.cpp), however it may contain a bug. Double check with lecture notes and comment the code!
5. Implement method ```Vec3f CShaderFlat::shade(const Ray& ray) const``` to use the texture coordinates returned by ```getTextureCoords()``` if texture exists.
6. Test your implementation with the texture of the earth by replacing color with texture ```pTexture``` in main.cpp for eyelight shader.

If everything is correct your images should look like this:

## Problem 4
### Texturing Solids (Points 25)
Now we continue with texturing the Solids, which consist out of triangles.
1. Class ```CPrimTriangle``` now contains additional variables ```m_ta```, ```m_tb``` and ```m_tc```, which correspond to the texture coordinates at vertices ```a```, ```b```, and ```c```, respectively. Here we use ```Vec2f```’s to store the texture coordinates (not ```Vec3f```), because they require only 2 coordinates (barycentric coordinates). 
2. Implement method ```Vec2f CPrimTriangle::getTextureCoords(const Ray& ray) const```. The method should return the _x_ and _y_ coordinates of the interpolated vertex texture coordinates.
3. Extend your code in ```CSolidSphere``` constructor in such a way that the triangles will be created with the additional texture coordinates. Calculate these coordiantes (_e.g._ using the spherical coordinate system) and pass them within the triangles' and quads' constructors.
4. Extend the code in ```CSolidCone``` constructor in such a way that the triangles will be created with the additional texture coordinates. Calculate these coordinates (_e.g._ using the cylindrical coordinate system) and pass them within the triangles' constructors. Which texture coordinate will you assign to the top of cylinder?
5. Test your implementation. Make sure that the spheres look the same.

If everything is correct your images should look like this:

## Bonus
### Texturing Barney (Points 20)
Now it is time to apply a texture to a more complex solid - a toy character Barney. In the data folder you will find files **barney.obj** and **barney.bmp**.
Using the expieriense gained so far, add to the scene Barney and apply his texture. For this you are free to add corresponding code to main.cpp file: comment out the existing geometry, add a second camera to the scene. Render the image.

Test your implementation on barney.obj with barney.bmp. If everything is correct your image should look like this:
![barney](./doc/barney.jpg)
